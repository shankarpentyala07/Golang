Syntax:

// Struct names begin with a capital letter in Go
type NameOfStruct struct {
  // Struct fields go here
}


Letâ€™s say we want to define a 2D point with an x and y coordinate. We could define two variables x and y and use them throughout our program. However, using multiple related variables in this way is error-prone. We might use x when we mean y, and dealing with many points could cause confusion.

A better way to represent a 2D point is to create a struct called Point which contains both coordinates. Defining Point in this way logically groups together the relevant data types. We would define the struct for Point like so:

type Point struct {
  x int
  y int
}

Using this new type, we would be able to pass Point information around our program as a single variable!
