Overview:

A group of related variables can be defined as a struct. Each variable within a struct is known as a field.

A struct must be defined before it can be used in a program. The definition of a struct includes its name and its fields.


type Point struct{
  x int
  y int
}

An instance of a defined struct can be created by providing its name followed by a set of curly braces with optional values.

p1 := Point{x: 10, y: 12}

Fields within a struct can be accessed or modified using the . operator.

p1 := Point{x:10, y:12}
fmt.Println(p1.x)

Methods can be associated with a struct by naming a struct parameter in parentheses before the function name.

func (rectangle Rectangle) area()  float32{
  return rectangle.length * rectangle.height
}

func main() {
  rect.area()
}

The values of a struct can only be modified in a function if the struct is passed as a pointer.

func (rectangle *Rectangle) modify(newLength float32){
  rectangle.length = newLength
}

Accessing the fields of a pointer to a struct does not require dereferencing. The fields of the struct pointer can be accessed using the normal . syntax.

steve := Employee{“Steve”, “Stevens”, 34, “Junior Manager”}
pointerToSteve := &steve
fmt.Println(pointerToSteve.firstName)

Arrays can be used to store many of the same struct’s instances.

points := []Point{{1, 1}, {7, 27}, {12, 7}, {9, 25}}

A struct can contain fields that are themselves other structs.

type Name struct{
  firstName string
  lastName string
}

type Employee struct{
  name Name
  age int
  title string
}

Congratulations on finishing the lesson. Now that you understand structs, you can use them to define custom collections of variables in your programs!



Syntax:

// Struct names begin with a capital letter in Go
type NameOfStruct struct {
  // Struct fields go here
}


Let’s say we want to define a 2D point with an x and y coordinate. We could define two variables x and y and use them throughout our program. However, using multiple related variables in this way is error-prone. We might use x when we mean y, and dealing with many points could cause confusion.

A better way to represent a 2D point is to create a struct called Point which contains both coordinates. Defining Point in this way logically groups together the relevant data types. We would define the struct for Point like so:

type Point struct {
  x int
  y int
}

Using this new type, we would be able to pass Point information around our program as a single variable!

To use a struct we just defined, we have to create an instance of it. Assume we defined Point from the last exercise. We could create an instance of it like so:

p1 := Point{x: 10, y: 12}

or

var p1 = Point{x: 10, y: 12}

Using this syntax, we can define values for each of the struct’s fields. However, Go allows us to rely on default values as well. We can omit fields:

p1 := Point{x: 10}
// y will be set to 0

In fact, we can omit all fields to rely only on default values:

p1 := Point{}
// x and y will be set to 0

The order of our struct definition allows us to avoid labeling our fields. The values are assigned from left to right according to how the fields are defined in the struct from top to bottom.

p1 := Point{10, 12}
// Same as var p1 = Point{10, 12}

When not using labels, we must provide values for every field; otherwise, our code will not compile.
